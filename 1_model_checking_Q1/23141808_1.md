## Question 1 - b

### LTL 1

**Statement**: b will be true at some point.

```c
ltl p1 {<>(b == true)}
```

This **statement should hold**, because the counter cycles between 15 and 31 as soon as $x >= 15$.
This means, that the action $x < 20$ can also be executed, whcih makes b true.

### LTL 2

**Statement**: x will always be >= 15.

```c
ltl p2 {[](x >= 15)}
```

As the counter $x$ starts from 0, this statement **should not hold**.

### LTL 3

**Statement**: At some point, x will be 15.

```c
ltl p3 {<>(x == 15)}
```

The counter $x$ increases all the time as soon as it's $>= 15$. When it hits 31 it gets reverted to 15,
so $x$ will be 15 at some point and therefore the **statement is true**.

### LTL 4

**Statement**: At some point, x will be 16.

```c
ltl p4 {<>(x == 16)}
```

The counter $x$ increases all the time and then cycles between 15 and 31, so $x$ will be 16 at some point,
and therefore the **statement is true**.

### LTL 5

**Statement**: From some point on, x will always be >= 16.

```c
ltl p5 {<>([](x >= 16))}
```

When x reaches 31 it gets reverted to 15, so the statement is not true anymore and **shouldn't hold**.

### LTL 6

**Statement**: x will infinitely often be 16.

```c
ltl p6 {[] (<>(x == 16))}
```

The counter can cycle between 15 and 31 as soon as $x$ >= 15, which means it will hit 16 infinitely often,
so the **statement should hold**.

### LTL 7

**Statement**: If b will never be true, then x will infinitely often be 16.

```c
ltl p7 {[] (b == false -> ([] (<> (x == 16))))}
```

When b is always false, it means that only the second action of the cycle gets executed each time.
That means, that once the counter $x$ reaches 15 it will always cycle from 15 to 31.
That also means, that $x$ will be 16 infinitely often, which means the**statement should hold**.
